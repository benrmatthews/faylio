      <h3 class="center">Why faylio?</h3>
      <br>
      <p>We live in a culture that celebrates success but doesn't easily admit failure. 90% of startups fail, but there are rarely assessments by founders of why they fails. Mistakes happen in big companies all the time, but are often swept under the carpet. Individuals make mistakes everyday in a range of areas - from cooking and gardening to love and relationships.<br>
      <br>We need to create a culture of sharing our failures so that we are more ready to accept failure as an inevitable part of our lives, so we can grow stronger from admitting those failures, and so we can learn from and teach others on how to do better in these areas.<br>
